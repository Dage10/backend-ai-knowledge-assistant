# 📖 Overview

AI Knowledge Assistant is a full-stack application that demonstrates how a modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system works.

Instead of allowing an LLM to answer using its own knowledge, the application retrieves only the relevant sections of a document and sends them as context to Google Gemini.

This approach provides:

- Accurate answers based only on uploaded documents
- Lower hallucination rate
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Conversation history per document
- Persistent document storage
- Modern cloud deployment

The project was developed as a portfolio project to showcase practical software engineering skills, backend development, frontend development, databases, cloud deployment and AI integration.

# ⚙ AI Pipeline

The complete RAG pipeline implemented by the application:

### 1. Upload PDF

User uploads a PDF document.

↓

### 2. Extract Text

The backend extracts all textual content using pdf-parse.

↓

### 3. Split into Chunks

The document is divided into overlapping chunks to improve semantic retrieval.

↓

### 4. Generate Embeddings

Each chunk is transformed into a 768-dimensional vector using Google's Gemini Embedding model.

↓

### 5. Store

Chunks and vectors are stored inside PostgreSQL.

↓

### 6. Ask Question

The user asks a natural language question.

↓

### 7. Embed Question

The question is converted into another embedding.

↓

### 8. Semantic Search

The backend retrieves the five most similar chunks using pgvector similarity search.

↓

### 9. Prompt Construction

Only those retrieved chunks become the context for Gemini.

↓

### 10. AI Response

Gemini generates an answer using only the provided context.

# 🔑 Environment Variables

## Backend

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3001

DATABASE_URL=

GEMINI_API_KEY=

FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
```

---

## Frontend

Create:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-render-url.onrender.com
```

---

# ☁ Deployment

## Frontend

Deploy using **Vercel**.

Configure:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

with your backend URL.

---

## Backend

Deploy using **Render**.

Required variables:

- DATABASE_URL

# 🗄 Database Design

The application uses PostgreSQL with pgvector.

Main tables:

## documents

Stores uploaded PDFs.

| Column | Description |
|----------|------------|
| id | Primary key |
| name | Original filename |
| text | Extracted document text |
| file_hash | SHA-256 duplicate detection |
| created_at | Upload timestamp |

---

## chunks

Stores semantic chunks.

| Column | Description |
|----------|------------|
| id | Primary key |
| document_id | Foreign key |
| content | Chunk text |
| chunk_index | Chunk order |
| embedding | pgvector embedding |

---

## conversations

Stores chat history.

| Column | Description |
|----------|------------|
| id | Primary key |
| document_id | Related document |
| question | User question |
| answer | AI response |
| created_at | Timestamp |

# 🧩 Design Decisions

Several architectural decisions were made to improve maintainability and scalability.

### Why chunking?

Large documents exceed the context window of modern LLMs.

Splitting documents into overlapping chunks significantly improves retrieval quality while preserving semantic continuity.

---

### Why embeddings?

Traditional keyword search fails when users ask questions using different wording.

Embeddings enable semantic retrieval rather than lexical matching.

---

### Why Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

Instead of relying on the LLM's internal knowledge, only relevant document fragments are provided.

Benefits:

- Lower hallucination rate
- Better factual accuracy
- Reduced prompt size
- Faster inference

---

### Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL offers:

- ACID compliance
- Mature ecosystem
- pgvector support
- Excellent cloud providers (Neon)

---

# ⚡ Performance

Current optimizations include:

- Semantic retrieval limited to Top-5 chunks
- Chunk overlap to preserve context
- Vector similarity search
- SHA-256 duplicate detection
- Connection pooling
- File upload limits
- Express rate limiting

---

# 🔐 Security

The application includes several security best practices.

✔ Helmet security headers

✔ CORS configuration

✔ Environment variables

✔ SQL parameterized queries

✔ Request validation

✔ Upload size restrictions

✔ Rate limiting

✔ Duplicate upload prevention

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

- User authentication (JWT)
- Multiple users
- Document sharing
- Streaming AI responses
- Citation highlighting
- OCR support
- Markdown rendering
- Redis caching
- Background embedding generation
- Docker support
- Kubernetes deployment
- CI/CD pipeline
